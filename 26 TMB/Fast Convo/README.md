# Fast Convo for Tomb of the Lost Queen

Fast Convo is an ability to skip in-game dialogues between characters. The feature first appeared in the Ghost of Thornton Hall for all players, not only via the built-in developer menu. This mod especially useful when you decided to replay your favorite games, but don't want to waste your time.
