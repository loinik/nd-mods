## User Guides

### Repair

If any mod doesn't work, please open the only one `.ini` file in the game root directory and check the `ExternalCifFileChecking` option. There should be `1` after the equal mark. Change if necessary.

### Disable all mods

If you want to disable all mods in your Nancy Drew game you should change the `ExternalCifFileChecking` option to `0`. This way you don't have to delete anything.
